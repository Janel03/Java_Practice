if the first number is a multiple of the second, and "not a multiple" otherwise.
4. Write a program that prompts the user for a month (as an integer) and then prints the number
of days in that month. Be sure to account for leap years!
5. Write a program that prompts the user for a year and then prints whether or
not the year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4,
unless it is also divisible by 100 and not 400.*/
